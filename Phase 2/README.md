# Phjase 2 - Indexing optimisation and Searching

The final wikipedia data corpus which we indexed was over 90 GB in size. Hence, we needed to optimise the indexer further to reduce space and improve the indexing time. This is the optimised version of the indexer: [`Indexer`](./Indexer.py).

The code for the Searcher is implemented in [`Searcher`](./Search.py)

To run the searcher:
Given that the queries are in a file named queries.txt

```
$ python3 Search.py queries.txt
```

This will output the top 10 queries.
Ranking of the documents is done by finding the TF-IDF score.

However, the indexer must be run before the Searcher, because, to search, the searcher must be provided with the postings lists, which is generated by the indexer.
